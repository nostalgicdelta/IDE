GitHub seems like an easy way to create and host a portfolio. It is free and can save all of my work on the cloud. Having Everything on the cloud means that I can direct anyone to a link rather then sending them my portfolio another way. Since Git and GitHub are well known it won't be an ask for a potential employer to see or review my previous work. It can also be a way to display both my schoolwork and side projects I might want to do in the future.
